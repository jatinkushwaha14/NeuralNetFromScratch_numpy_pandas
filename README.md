# NeuralNetFromScratch_numpy_pandas
This project implements a simple neural network using NumPy to classify MNIST handwritten digits. The network consists of two layers and uses ReLU activation for the hidden layer and softmax for the output layer. Key components include data loading, forward propagation, backward propagation, parameter updates, and model evaluation.
